## Abstract

This study compares the playing styles of NBA teams and their affiliated G-League teams. Specifically, it examines whether the developmental teams follow the same strategy ideas as their parent organizations. The G-League is becoming increasingly important for developing players and finding new ones. Knowing how the styles of these teams are similar across the different levels can help with company cohesion and player growth. 

## Problem Statement

If NBA and G-League teams all have the same basketball mindset, it will help players prepare for the next level and improve their strategy execution. However, how much G-League teams copy the way NBA teams play still needs to be clarified. "Do G-League teams play the same style of basketball as their affiliated NBA teams?" is the question this study tries to answer.

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant difference in the playing styles of NBA teams and their G-League affiliates.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There are significant differences in the playing styles of NBA teams and their G-League affiliates.

## Methodology

Fast-Paced Offense, Defensive-Oriented, Three-Point Heavy, Iso-Heavy, Big-Man Centric, Motion Offense, Grit-and-Grind, Switch-Heavy Defense, Balanced/Adaptive, and Post-Up Inside Scoring are some of the playing styles that will be put into these groups. The statistical analysis will use game data from the NBA and G-League seasons available to the public. This data will include pace, defensive rating, offensive efficiency, shot selection, and lineup compositions. Machine learning grouping methods will divide teams into groups based on their playing styles. Then, similarity measures (such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance) will be used to compare the styles of G-League and NBA teams.

## Expected Outcomes

We expect to find patterns in which G-League teams closely match the styles of their NBA affiliates, especially in groups that stress developing continuity, like the Golden State Warriors and Santa Cruz Warriors. On the other hand, teams with different G-League coaching styles may have more artistic differences.

## Significance

The results will give us helpful information about how stylistic alignment can help players grow, teams work together better, and organizations run more smoothly generally. Past studies on organizational alignment (e.g., Foster et al., 2016) and player development pipelines (e.g., Henderson et al., 2019) show that strategic continuity makes players better at their jobs and makes moving to higher levels easier. This study builds on those frameworks to show how harmonized basketball beliefs could give teams a competitive edge.
